"""Build the Stream to Shorts app with PyInstaller.

Output lands in dist/. On Windows that is a StreamToShorts folder, or a single
StreamToShorts.exe with --onefile (slower to start, since it unpacks to a temp
dir each launch, but the only build that can replace itself when an update
arrives). On macOS it is StreamToShorts.app, a bundle you drag to Applications.

PyInstaller cannot cross-compile: a Windows build has to be made on Windows and
a mac build on a Mac. The release workflow runs one of each.

Optional: drop ffmpeg and ffprobe into a ./bin folder before building and they
get bundled, so users don't have to install ffmpeg themselves. Without them the
app still builds and tells the user what's missing at startup.
