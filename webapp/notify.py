"""Tell the user a run has finished, when they are not there to see it.

A long VOD takes tens of minutes to transcribe, rank and render. Nobody sits
and watches that. The window goes behind a game, or gets minimised, or the tab
it opened is three deep -- and the clips sit there finished, with nothing to
say so, until somebody thinks to go and look.

This is the "somebody thinks to look" part, moved into the app.

Three platforms, three mechanisms, and not one of them a new dependency:

    Windows   a toast, raised through PowerShell's WinRT bindings
    macOS     osascript, which every Mac has
    Linux     notify-send, which most desktops have and some do not

Every one of them is allowed to fail. A notification that never arrives is a
disappointment. A render that dies because a notification did not arrive would
be a bug -- so nothing in this module raises, and the work it does happens on a
thread of its own so that a slow PowerShell start cannot hold up the queue.

Quiet when someone is looking
-----------------------------
The page reports whether it is actually on screen and focused, and a run that
finishes while somebody is watching it raises nothing: they can already see it.
The report is a heartbeat rather than a flag, so a window that was closed, or a
tab that went away without saying goodbye, stops counting on its own.
