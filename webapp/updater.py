"""In-place updates for the packaged app.

The app is a single unsigned .exe that people download once and keep. Without
this they have no way to learn a new version exists, short of visiting the
repository on a hunch -- so a fix can ship and never reach the person it was
written for.

How the swap works
------------------
Windows will not let a running .exe be overwritten, but it will happily let it
be *renamed*. So the running file is moved aside rather than deleted, the new
build takes its place, and the app relaunches from the same path. The stale
file is removed on the next start, once nothing has it open.

Linux needs none of that -- a running binary can be replaced underneath itself,
because the kernel holds on to the inode rather than the name -- but it is done
the same way there regardless. One path through this, exercised on both
platforms, beats two where the one nobody runs is the one that breaks.

That ordering matters: the rename happens only after the download is complete
and its hash checked, so a half-downloaded or tampered file never becomes the
thing that runs. If anything fails before that point the running exe has not
been touched at all.

What this deliberately does not do
----------------------------------
It never runs the downloaded file to "install" anything, and it never takes a
URL from the page. The repository is compiled in, the asset URL comes from
GitHub's API response for that repository, and the download must match the
SHA-256 that the API reports. The app is unsigned, so this is integrity
against a corrupted or swapped download, not proof of authorship -- but it is
the strongest check available without a code-signing certificate.

Only the one-file build can update itself, on Windows and on Linux alike. The
one-folder build is hundreds of files, and swapping those under a running
process is a different and far more fragile problem, so it is told to update
by hand instead. The mac build is a
.app -- a folder by another name, signed as one unit -- and is told the same.
Checking still happens everywhere: knowing a new version exists is most of the
value, and it is the half that cannot go wrong.
