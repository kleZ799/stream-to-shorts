"""Background job runner for the web UI.

The pipeline takes minutes, not milliseconds — transcription alone can run
longer than any sensible HTTP timeout. So a request only ever *enqueues* work;
progress is streamed separately over SSE.

Jobs run one at a time on a single worker thread. That's deliberate: Whisper
and ffmpeg are both CPU-bound, and running two at once makes both slower than
running them in sequence.

Finished jobs are written to disk as a `job.json` beside their clips, and read
back at startup. Without that, the store was purely in-memory: close the app
and every clip you had ever made became unreachable through the UI even though
the mp4s were still sitting in the folder.
