The updater compares this against the newest GitHub release, so it has to be
the same number the exe reports in its own properties. build_exe.py checks
version_info.txt against it and refuses to build if they have drifted -- a
build that ships as 1.4.0 while telling the updater it is 1.3.2 would offer
every user an update to the version they are already running.
