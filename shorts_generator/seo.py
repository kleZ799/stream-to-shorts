"""Per-clip YouTube metadata: the title, description and tags to upload with.

A rendered clip is only half the job. What decides whether a Short gets seen is
the packaging around it - a title that earns the tap, a description that tells
the algorithm what the clip is about, and tags that put it next to the videos
its audience already watches.

Those three are not equal, and the prompt below is built around the order.
Titles and descriptions are the strong ranking signals; the first three
hashtags in the description are what viewers actually see, rendered as links
above the title; tags are a weak supporting signal that a long list only
dilutes. And the title has one job before any of that: it has to NAME the
thing. A title lifted straight out of the transcript reads fine to someone who
watched the stream and is invisible to everyone else, because it contains no
word anyone would ever search or browse for.

Naming the thing is also where this used to go wrong. The subject was worked
out once per video, from its listing and transcript, and every clip was filed
under it. A variety stream titled "The Finals" that moved on to Firewatch and a
horror game came back with Firewatch clips tagged #thefinals. So each clip now
carries a `scene` -- what its own frames show, from vision.py -- and the
subject a clip is filed under comes from that first. The run-level subject is
only a fallback for clips the frames do not contradict.

Nothing about a clip is assumed to be gaming either. The scene says what kind
of video it is -- a podcast, a face-cam story, a tutorial -- and the format
tags and the framing of the title follow from that.

And the writer no longer hands back one title. It writes several, each on a
different angle, scores them against a rubric, and the app blends that with a
check of its own (length, whether the subject is named, filler) to rank them.
The best one is used; the rest are kept so the person uploading can pick.

It is deliberately best-effort: SEO text sits on top of a clip that already
exists, so every failure path here falls back to something usable rather than
sinking a run that has already paid for a download, a transcription and a
render.

SOURCE VIDEO
{video_context}

{subject_block}

You are given {n} clips cut from that video, already ranked best to worst by viral potential. For EACH clip, write upload-ready metadata.

THE TWO RULES THAT OUTRANK EVERYTHING BELOW:
1. ACCURATE. Every claim must be provable from that clip's own WHAT IS ON SCREEN and WHAT IS ACTUALLY SAID blocks. Never promise a reveal the clip does not contain, never name a person, game or number the clip does not support, never imply a stake the clip does not reach. A title the clip fails to deliver gets swiped in two seconds, and short-form ranking punishes that harder than a boring title ever could.
2. VIRAL. Within what is true, pick the most arresting framing. The strongest hook is almost always a real specific detail from the clip - the exact number, the exact word, the actual thing that happened on screen - not a vague tease. Specific and true beats sensational and empty every time.

WHAT EACH CLIP IS ABOUT - read this before writing anything:
- Each clip has a WHAT IS ON SCREEN block, taken from its own frames. It says what kind of video the clip is and what is in it, and it OUTRANKS the source video's title. A stream titled after one game can wander into three others; the frames say which one this clip is.
- If the block says the subject is CONFIRMED, name it. If it gives only an UNCONFIRMED guess, do NOT print that name anywhere - use the genre instead ("this horror game", "a co-op shooter"). A wrong name is the one thing the exact audience that would watch will call out in the comments.
- Do not assume gaming. A podcast clip is packaged like a podcast clip, a story told to camera like a story. Write for the kind of video the clip actually is.

HOW SHORTS ARE ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED - write for this, not for a search engine:
- The title is read in well under a second, on a phone, next to a video that is already playing. Only about the first 40 characters are sure to be seen. Front-loaded and concrete beats complete and tidy.
- Shorts are also found through search. A title that contains the phrase someone would type ("firewatch ending", "podcast guest storms out") is found for months; one that does not is found only while the feed is pushing it.
- Titles and descriptions outrank tags as ranking signals. The words that name the subject must appear in the title and in the first line of the description, not only in the tag box.
- The FIRST THREE hashtags in the description are shown as clickable links above the title. They must be the terms this clip should be filed under.
- A hashtag in the TITLE buys nothing and spends characters you need for keywords. No hashtags in titles.
- 3-5 hashtags total. Past 15 every hashtag on the video is ignored outright.

REACHING PAST THE AUDIENCE THE CHANNEL ALREADY HAS:
- WRITE FOR A STRANGER. Assume the viewer has never heard of this creator and has never played the game or seen the show. Insider framing - a nickname, a running joke, "he did it again" - caps the clip at the audience it started with.
- PAIR THE NARROW TERM WITH A BROAD ONE. The exact name makes a clip findable; the category it belongs to makes it recommendable to people who would never search that name.
- NO TWO CLIPS IN THIS SET MAY LEAD THE SAME WAY. They will be posted to one channel; if every best title opens the same way they compete for one slice of the feed.
- NEVER WIDEN BY LYING. Broadening is a choice of plainer words, never a bigger claim.

TITLE_OPTIONS - write exactly {options} titles per clip, each on a DIFFERENT angle:
- "search": leads with the phrase a person would actually type to find this moment
- "curiosity": says enough to raise a question, withholds the answer
- "reaction": names who reacted and how hard, and to what
- "detail": the exact number, object, line or event lifted from the clip
- "contradiction" or "stakes": the outcome fights the setup, or names what is about to go wrong or right
Every option: 35-70 characters (hard limit {title_limit}), the first 3-4 words carry the payoff, names the subject when it is confirmed, sentence case or title case, at most one emoji, no hashtags, no ALL CAPS, no filler like "you won't believe" or "wait for it". A transcript line pasted in is NOT a title.
Score each option honestly, as an editor would before posting:
- "hook" 0-40: would a stranger stop scrolling for it?
- "clarity" 0-20: does a stranger understand what the clip is from the title alone?
- "search" 0-20: does it contain a phrase people really search?
- "truth" 0-20: does the clip fully deliver it? Anything under 20 overclaims.
Then list the options best first.

DESCRIPTION rules:
- Line 1: the hook as a full sentence, containing the main search phrase - it is the only line most viewers ever see
- Lines 2-3: what actually happens, in plain words, naming the subject (only if confirmed) and the kind of moment it is. This is the text the ranker reads to decide who to show the clip to, so spend it on real nouns, not adjectives
- Then one short call to action: a specific question about THIS clip beats "comment below"
- Then one line of 3-5 hashtags, #shorts first, then the most specific ones for this clip. Lowercase, no spaces inside a hashtag
- Under 500 characters. Plain text, no markdown

TAGS - 14-20 lowercase tags per clip, ranked most valuable first, each labelled with its kind:
- "subject": the exact name of what the clip is about (only if confirmed) - always first
- "variant": other ways people write it - abbreviations, the name without spaces, a common misspelling
- "query": a real multi-word search a person would type to find this moment ("firewatch delilah radio", "the finals destruction")
- "genre": the category ("horror games", "comedy podcast")
- "moment": what kind of moment it is ("jumpscare", "funny moments", "plot twist")
- "format": what kind of video it is, matched to the clip ("gameplay", "podcast clips", "storytime") - never "gaming" for a clip that is not gameplay
Nothing invented, no hashes, no duplicates, nothing over 30 characters.

HOOK_TEXT rules:
- The on-screen caption burned over the first 2 seconds, read while the clip is already playing
- Under 8 words, sentence case, no ending punctuation
- It must raise something the next three seconds answer
- Never the same sentence as any title

SEARCH_PHRASE: the single phrase this clip should rank for, 2-5 words, lowercase.

WHY_IT_WORKS: one sentence for the channel owner about the best title: which angle it takes and what it is betting on.

If the video genuinely has no nameable subject, or clearly covers several things equally, use an empty string rather than picking one.
- "kind" is one of: game, show, movie, person, sport, topic, none
- "format" is what kind of video it is: gameplay stream, variety stream, podcast, just chatting, storytelling, tutorial, irl, reaction, other
- "also_known_as" lists up to 3 other names real people use for the subject. Empty list if none.
- "all_subjects" lists EVERY game, show, product or named topic that the listing or the samples mention as being played, watched or discussed - up to 10. A variety stream will have several. Only names that are actually there.
- "hashtags" is 2-4 hashtags for the main subject and its niche, lowercase, no spaces, no #shorts.
- "tags" is 3-6 lowercase search terms for the main subject and its category.
- Never guess. Everything here must be supported by the listing or the samples above.
