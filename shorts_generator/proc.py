"""Every external program this app runs goes through here.

Two problems, one place to solve them.

**No console windows.** A windowed build has no console of its own, so every
time Windows starts a console program from it — ffmpeg, ffprobe, yt-dlp's own
ffmpeg calls — it helpfully creates a new one. The result is black windows
flashing open and shut throughout a run, dozens of them on a long video. People
reasonably read that as malware, and a tool that looks like malware does not get
run twice. CREATE_NO_WINDOW stops it.

**Pause.** Rendering saturates the CPU, which is fine until someone wants to use
their machine for something else. Pausing a job means actually suspending the
processes doing the work, not just declining to start the next one: ffmpeg holds
every core it can get, and asking it to stop politely between clips is no help
to someone whose machine is unusable *now*.

So this module keeps a registry of the children it started, suspends them on
request, and blocks the worker before it starts another.
