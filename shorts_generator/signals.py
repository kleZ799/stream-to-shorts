"""Measured hook signals: what the footage itself says about a moment.

Ranking used to be one opinion — an LLM reading a transcript. That opinion is
good at meaning and blind to sound. It cannot hear the scream, the laugh, or
the half-second of silence before the punchline, because none of that is
written down. Two moments can read identically on the page and be worlds apart
in the audio, and the audio is what a viewer actually meets in the first
second.

So this module measures the things a transcript cannot carry, per the clip
rule book:

  * audio energy spike   — a loudness jump against the video's own baseline
  * keyword trigger      — the phrases that mark surprise and payoff
  * silence-to-peak      — a quiet beat right before the spike (build-up)
  * dialogue density     — words per second, which is how dead air is caught

Two signals from the rule book are deliberately absent. Chat velocity would be
the strongest ground truth there is, and it needs a chat log this app never
receives; face reaction needs a face model per frame, which costs more than the
whole render. Rather than scoring them zero and quietly shrinking every clip's
ceiling, their weight is redistributed across the signals that ARE available —
so a score of 80 means the same thing whatever was measurable.

Everything here is best-effort. No audio track, no numpy, no ffmpeg: the text
signals still work, the weights redistribute again, and the run continues. A
ranking aid must never be able to sink a render.
