"""Local clipping: ffmpeg subclip + face-following vertical crop.

Two stages per highlight:
  1. Cut the source video to [start, end] with ffmpeg (re-encoded, audio kept).
  2. Reframe the cut to the target aspect ratio, with a crop window that
     follows the speaker's face the way a camera operator would.

The second stage used to chase a Haar detection on every frame, easing 15% of
the way toward wherever the newest detection landed. That looks smooth on
paper and stutters on screen: Haar boxes wobble by several pixels between
identical frames, a false positive in the background yanks the window for a
few frames, and a crop that is always moving a little reads as a shaky camera.

So the path is now planned before a single frame is rendered:

  detect    faces sampled ~8 times a second, following one person and ignoring
            a face that appears for a frame or two
  clean     gaps held, spikes removed with a median filter
  operate   the window does not move while the face stays inside a dead zone;
            when it leaves, the window re-centres on it
  ease      the re-centres are smoothed with a zero-lag Gaussian, so every
            move eases in and out and nothing trails behind the face
  render    one ffmpeg pass, the crop driven frame by frame from the plan

A hard cut in the source (the camera switching to the other podcast host) is
kept as a cut rather than swept across as a pan, which is what an editor would
do too.
