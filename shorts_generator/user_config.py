The .env file works fine when you cloned the source, but someone running a
packaged build has no repo to edit. This keeps their API key in the platform's
normal per-user config location instead, so the app can ask for it once in the
UI and remember it.

Precedence is deliberate: a real environment variable always wins, so an
existing .env setup keeps behaving exactly as before.
