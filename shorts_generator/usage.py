"""A running count of API requests, so a day's budget is visible before it runs out.

Gemini's free tier caps requests *per day*, not per minute, and the only way
the app learned it had hit the cap was a 429 three chunks into a run that had
already paid for a download and a transcription. This keeps a local tally so
the number can be shown up front and a run can pick up the next day knowing
what it already spent.

The tally is local and therefore advisory: the same key used from another
machine, or another app, spends quota this file never sees. So a 429 that says
the daily quota is gone is treated as the truth and overrides the count --
`mark_exhausted()` exists for exactly that.

Google's free-tier day rolls over at midnight US Pacific, not local midnight
and not UTC, so that is the boundary used here.
