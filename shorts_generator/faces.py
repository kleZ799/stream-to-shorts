"""Face detection, done one way for the whole app.

Two renderers need faces: the stacked layout, to find the streamer in the
webcam overlay, and the face-following crop, to keep a speaker in frame. Both
used Haar cascades, and Haar is the weakest part of either. It is a 2001
detector of frontal faces: a head turned to talk to a co-host, a dim room, a
large headset or a hand over the mouth and it sees nothing -- which is why the
face crop needed a second, profile cascade run in both directions, and why the
stacked layout needed a twenty-frame vote to stay on the right person.

YuNet is a small learned detector (about 230 KB, from OpenCV's own model zoo)
that OpenCV runs natively through FaceDetectorYN. It finds faces at angles and
in light that Haar cannot, gives each one a confidence, and runs in about 12 ms
on a 960px frame on a laptop CPU. The model ships inside every build, under
assets/models, so nothing is downloaded at run time.

Haar stays as the fallback. If the model file is missing, or this OpenCV has no
FaceDetectorYN, or the model will not load, detection drops back to exactly
what it was before rather than failing -- and says so once in the log.
