"""Which processor does the heavy lifting: the video encoder and Whisper's device.

Two stages can use a GPU, and they need different things from it.

**Encoding** every clip is ffmpeg's work, and ffmpeg can hand it to the
graphics chip: NVENC on NVIDIA, VideoToolbox on a Mac, Quick Sync on Intel,
AMF on AMD. That needs only the graphics driver the machine already has, and
it frees the CPU for everything else.

**Transcription** runs on CTranslate2, which can use an NVIDIA GPU through
CUDA -- but only if NVIDIA's CUDA maths libraries (cuBLAS, cuDNN) are present.
The published single-file builds leave those out on purpose: they would add
about 2 GB to every download. So on most NVIDIA machines the GPU is *there*,
CTranslate2 counts it, the run starts on it, and then dies looking for
cublas64_12.dll. That fell back to the CPU, but only after printing an error
that read like the app had broken. So the libraries are now checked for
before the GPU is tried, and a missing one is a plain sentence in the log.

The setting has three values, stored as PROCESSOR:

  auto  the fastest thing that actually works here, found by trying it
  gpu   the same search, but said out loud when there is no GPU to use
  cpu   never touch a GPU -- the escape hatch for a driver that misbehaves

Nothing is assumed from a name. An encoder that ffmpeg lists is given a
one-second test encode before it is used, and one that fails mid-run is
dropped for the rest of the run and the clip is redone on the CPU. Every test
goes through proc.run, so Pause holds it like any other ffmpeg call.
