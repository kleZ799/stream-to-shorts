"""Put the hook at the very front of the clip, even when it happens later.

The cut rules already open every clip on its hook line. That is the right
answer when the hook IS the opening line. It is not always available: some
moments are a build and a payoff, and the payoff is the part that stops a
scroll — a scream, a laugh, the thing going wrong. Open on the build and the
first second is a person talking quietly; open on the payoff and the clip makes
no sense.

So the clip gets a cold open: a second or two of its own loudest moment, played
first, then the clip in full from the top. The viewer meets the payoff before
they have decided whether to stay, and then watches it arrive properly. It is
the oldest trick in short-form editing and it works for the same reason the
rule book's first-frame rule does — the first second is the audition.

Two things keep it honest:

  * It only runs when the peak is actually late. If the loudest moment is
    already in the first few seconds, the clip opens on it anyway and a replay
    would just be a stutter.
  * The length it adds is reserved before the cut is chosen, not bolted on
    afterwards, so a request for 30-second clips still yields 30-second files.
