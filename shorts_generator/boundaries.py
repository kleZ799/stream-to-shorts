"""Where a clip actually starts and stops.

The model proposes a span. It is good at finding the moment and bad at the two
things that decide whether the moment survives contact with a feed:

**Length.** Ask for 30-second clips and a model will hand back 19s, 24s, 47s —
close enough to look obedient in a list, and nowhere near what was asked for.
It is not being careless; it is estimating durations from timestamps it half
remembers while also writing JSON. Length is arithmetic, so it is done here,
where it can simply be true.

**The opening.** A Short is auditioned in its first second, so the clip has to
open ON the hook rather than on the run-up to it. The model is told this in the
prompt and it names the line it means (`first_line`) — but the timestamp it
pairs with that line routinely lands seconds early, on the throat-clear before
it. The line is the reliable part of that answer, so the line is what the start
time is derived from.

Everything is snapped to transcript segment boundaries, which is where the
speaker actually paused. That is the difference between a clip that opens on a
word and one that opens halfway through a syllable — and it means enforcing a
length never cuts mid-sentence, which is the one thing worse than the wrong
length.
