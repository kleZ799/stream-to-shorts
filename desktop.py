"""Desktop entry point — Stream to Shorts as an app window, not a website.

Starts the local server on a free port in a background thread, then opens it
in a native window (Edge WebView2 on Windows, WebKit elsewhere) so there is no
address bar, no browser tab, and nothing for the user to "visit".

If a native webview isn't available it falls back to the default browser
rather than failing, because a working browser window beats no app at all.

Run from source:   python desktop.py
Packaged:          StreamToShorts.exe, StreamToShorts.app on a Mac, or a bare
                   StreamToShorts binary on Linux
